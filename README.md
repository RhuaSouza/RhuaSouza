## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **fullstack developer** focused on **web and mobile development**, always improving my skills through hands-on projects.

I like understanding how applications work end to end — from **backend APIs and databases** to **frontend interfaces and mobile experiences**.

When I'm not coding, I usually enjoy playing games 🎮, watching movies 🎬 or listening to music 🎧.
